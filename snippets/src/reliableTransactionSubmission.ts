/**
 * When implementing Reliable Transaction Submission, there are many potential solutions, each with different trade-offs. The main decision points are:
 * 1) Transaction preparation:
 *    - How do we decide which account sequence and LastLedgerSequence numbers to use?
 *      (To prevent unintentional duplicate transactions, an {account, account_sequence} pair can be used as a transaction's idempotency key)
 *    - How do we decide how much to pay for the transaction fee? (If our transactions have been failing due to low fee, we should consider increasing this value)
 * 2) Transaction status retrieval. Options include:
 *    - Poll for transaction status:
 *      - On a regular interval (e.g. every 3-5 seconds), or
 *      - When a new validated ledger is detected
 *      + (To accommodate an edge case in transaction retrieval, check the sending account's Sequence number to confirm that it has the expected value;
 *         alternatively, wait until a few additional ledgers have been validated before deciding that a transaction has definitively not been included in a validated ledger)
 *    - Listen for transaction status: scan all validated transactions to see if our transactions are among them
 * 3) What do we do when a transaction fails? It is possible to implement retry logic, but caution is advised. Note that there are a few ways for a transaction to fail:
 *    A) `tec`: The transaction was included in a ledger but only claimed the transaction fee
 *    B) `tesSUCCESS` but unexpected result: The transaction was successful but did not have the expected result. This generally does not occur for XRP-to-XRP payments
 *    C) The transaction was not, and never will be, included in a validated ledger [3C]
 *

 *
 * For the implementation in this example, we have made the following decisions:
 * 1) The script will choose the account sequence and LastLedgerSequence numbers automatically. We allow ripple-lib to choose the fee.
 *    Payments are defined upfront, and idempotency is not needed. If the script is run a second time, duplicate payments will result.
 * 2) We will listen for notification that a new validated ledger has been found, and poll for transaction status at that time.
 *    Futhermore, as a precaution, we will wait until the server is 3 ledgers past the transaction's LastLedgerSequence
 *    (with the transaction nowhere to be seen) before deciding that it has definitively failed per [3C]
 * 3) Transactions will not be automatically retried. Transactions are limited to XRP-to-XRP payments and cannot "succeed" in an unexpected way.

## accountSetFlags

To modify account flags, you can use an AccountSet transaction and its `SetFlag` or `ClearFlag` fields.
	
The flags are called [AccountSet flags (asf*)](https://xrpl.org/accountset.html#accountset-flags):

`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.requireDestinationTag`: Require a destination tag to send transactions to this account.
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.requireAuthorization`: Require authorization for users to hold balances issued by this address. Can only be enabled if the address has no trust lines connected to it.
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.disallowIncomingXRP`: XRP should not be sent to this account. (Enforced by client applications, not by rippled)
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.disableMasterKey`: Disallow use of the master key pair. Can only be enabled if the account has configured another way to sign transactions.
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.enableTransactionIDTracking`: Track the ID of this account's most recent transaction.
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.noFreeze`: Permanently give up the ability to freeze individual trust lines or disable Global Freeze. This flag can never be disabled after being enabled.
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.globalFreeze`:	Freeze all assets issued by this account.
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.defaultRipple`: Enable [rippling](https://xrpl.org/rippling.html) on this account's trust lines by default.
`RippleAPI.accountSetFlags.depositAuth`:Enable Deposit Authorization on this account.
